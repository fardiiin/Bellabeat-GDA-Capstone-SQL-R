I delved into the FitBit fitness tracker user data, analyzing usage patterns and trends to influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy. The goal was to identify trends in smart device usage, understand their relevance to Bellabeat's customers, and utilize these insights to enhance the company's marketing efforts.
I employed Google's BigQuery, Excel, and R Programming Language to clean, analyze and vizualize the data. My analysis included a variety of aspects in the user data. This has allowed me to draw essential recommendations.
